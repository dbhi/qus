Tests
#####

Multiple alternatives exist to install QEMU, to register the interpreter and/or to use OCI containers.
The table below summarizes all the combinations that are tested on CI services in this project:

.. include:: TestsTable.inc

.. TIP::
  ``n`` is about executing a binary on the host, not inside a container.

where:

* ``$file`` is the ``qemu-*-static`` binary corresponding to the target architecture.
  In these tests: ``file=qemu-aarch64-static``.

* **-r|--clear**: clean any registered ``qemu-*`` interpreter.

* **-s|--static**: add ``--suffix -static`` to the args for ``qemu-binfmt-conf.sh``.

* **-p|--persistent**: if yes, the interpreter is loaded when ``binfmt`` is configured and remains in memory.
  All future uses are cloned from the open file.

* **vol**: whether the QEMU binary must be bind between the host and the container where target binaries are located.
  None of the methods with ``vol=y`` can be used for ``docker build``.
