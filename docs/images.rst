Provided container images
#########################

When QEMU is installed from distribution package managers, it is normally set up along with ``binfmt_misc``.
Nonetheless, in the context of this project we want to configure it with custom options, instead of relying on the
defaults.
A script provided by QEMU, `qemu-binfmt-conf.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qemu/qemu/master/scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh>`__,
can be used to do so.
Among other options, the flag that tells ``binfmt`` to hold interpreters in memory is supported in ``qemu-binfmt-conf.sh``,
as ``-p``.

This project uses a modified version of ``qemu-binfmt-conf.sh`` [#f1]_, which includes the following enhancements:

* Optionally, the list of QEMU interpreters to be registered on the host can be limited.
* Add option ``--clear``.
* Add option ``--test``.

In fact, the entrypoint to the following docker images is a wrapper [#f2]_ around ``qemu-binfmt-conf.sh`` to provide
some synctactic sugar.

Manifests
=========

Manifests are provided for the following hosts: ``amd64``, ``arm64v8``, ``arm32v7``, ``arm32v6``, ``i386``, ``s390x`` or
``ppc64le``.
That is, any of the target architectures provided by QEMU can be used on any of those hosts.

The procedure to generate each image involves extracting pre-built binaries and packaging them in container images,
along with helper scripts.
Hence, multiple images are generated in the process:

* ``aptman/qus:pkg``:
  all the ``qemu-*-static`` binaries from `packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-user-static <https://packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-user-static>`__
  extracted on a ``scratch`` image.

* ``aptman/qus:register``:
  a ``busybox`` image with :qussrc:`register.sh` and `qemu-binfmt-conf.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qemu/qemu/master/scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh>`__.
  The entrypoint is set to ``register.sh``.

* ``aptman/qus``:
  union of the two previous images.

.. TIP::
  Find usage instructions in the :qussrc:`README <README.md#usage>`.

Debian
======

For each ``HOST_ARCH``, an image named ``${HOST_ARCH}-d${VERSION}${TAG}`` is published; where ``TAG`` is
``-pkg|-register|""``.
Moreover, three manifests are available:
``aptman/qus:d${VERSION}-pkg``,
``aptman/qus:d${VERSION}-register``
and ``aptman/qus:d${VERSION}``.

.. TIP::
  ``latest``/default versions above correspond to these Debian variants. Therefore, running ``aptman/qus`` on an
  ``amd64`` host is equivalent to running ``aptman/qus:d6.2`` or ``aptman/qus:amd64-d6.2``.

Apart from those, ``aptman/qus:mips-pkg`` and ``aptman/qus:mips64el-pkg`` are also available.

Fedora
======

For each ``HOST_ARCH`` (except ``arm32v6``), an image named ``${HOST_ARCH}-f${VERSION}${TAG}`` is published; where
``TAG`` is ``-pkg|-register|""``.
Moreover, three manifests are available:
``aptman/qus:f${VERSION}-pkg``,
``aptman/qus:f${VERSION}-register``
and ``aptman/qus:f${VERSION}``.
