*qemu-user-static* (**qus**) is a compilation of utilities, examples and references to build and execute OCI images (aka [docker](https://www.docker.com/) images) for foreign architectures using [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)'s user-mode emulation.

- Ready-to-use docker images are provided for each of seven host architectures officially supported by Docker, Inc. or built by official images ([docker-library/official-images: Architectures other than amd64?](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64)): `amd64`, `i386`, `arm64v8`, `arm32v7`, `arm32v6`, `s390x` and `ppc64le`.
- Multiple minimal working setups to build and execute `arm64v8` containers on `amd64` are configured and tested on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dbhi/qus/actions). The full flow is public, for other users to learn and adapt these resources to their needs.
- These resources are tested on GNU/Linux and Windows 10 (Docker Desktop). Contributions to test them on other host OSs are welcome!

Find further details at [dbhi.github.io/qus](https://dbhi.github.io/qus).

# Usage

> NOTE: Although `docker` is used in these examples, users have reported that other engines such as [podman](https://podman.io/) can also be used. See also [kata-containers/runtime#1280](https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime/issues/1280).

## As a GitHub Action

Run the Action without arguments for registering all the supported interpreters:

```yaml
  - uses: dbhi/qus/action@main
```

Optionally, provide a space-separated list of target architectures:

```yaml
  - uses: dbhi/qus/action@main
    with:
      targets: arm aarch64
```

Then, execute foreign binaries and/or containers straightaway!

NOTE: [yaml-multiline.info](https://yaml-multiline.info)

## Setup

The recommended approach is to run the following container:

``` bash
docker run --rm --privileged aptman/qus -s -- -p [TARGET_ARCH]
```

> NOTE: since `aptman/qus` is a manifest, this command works on `amd64`, `arm64v8`, `arm32v7`, `arm32v6`, `i386`, `s390x` or `ppc64le` hosts.

The required `qemu-*-static` binaries (which are all included in the image) will be loaded and registered. The container will then exit. From there on, images and/or binaries for foreign architectures can be executed.

Optional argument `TARGET_ARCH` is the target architecture to be translated through QEMU. If it is omitted, all available targets will be registered and loaded. The supported values are the following:

```
i386 i486 alpha arm armeb sparc32plus ppc ppc64 ppc64le m68k mips mipsel mipsn32 mipsn32el mips64 mips64el sh4 sh4eb s390x aarch64 aarch64_be hppa riscv32 riscv64 xtensa xtensaeb microblaze microblazeel or1k x86_64
```

> NOTE: sudo privileges on the host are required in order to register `binfmt` formats.
> On GNU/Linux, it is possible to execute `register.sh` directly.
> On Windows, a container must be used, so that changes are applied to the underlying VM, since no kernel is available on the host
> (_i.e._, from the [test list](https://dbhi.github.io/qus/tests), only `C`, `V`, `I` or `D` will work on Windows).

## Reset

In order to unset the registered formats, and unload the binaries, run:

``` bash
docker run --rm --privileged aptman/qus -- -r
```

## Help

```sh
# docker run --rm --privileged aptman/qus -h
Usage: register.sh [--help][--interactive][--list][--static][-- ARGS]

  Wrapper around qemu-binfmt-conf.sh, to configure binfmt_misc to use qemu interpreter

  -h|--help|-help:
      display this usage

  -i|--interactive|-interactive:
      execute all the remaining args with 'sh -c', then exit

  -l|--list|-list:
      list currently registered interpreters

  -s|--static|-static:
      add '--qemu-suffix -static' to ARGS

  -- ARGS:
     arguments for qemu-binfmt-conf.sh

  To register a single static target persistently, use e.g.:

      register.sh -s -- -p aarch64

  To remove all register interpreters and exit, use:

      register.sh -- -r
```

## Bandwidth-efficient procedure

In contexts such as CI pipelines it might be desirable to reduce the required bandwidth. Hence, instead of using `aptman/qus` images —which include all the binaries for all the supported target architectures—, individual tarballs are available through GitHub Releases. These can be used along with `aptman/qus:register` images or with [`register.sh`](./register.sh) (without an OCI runtime). See either `f`, `F`, `c`, `C`, `v` or `V` in [Tests](https://dbhi.github.io/qus/tests) for examples of these use cases.
